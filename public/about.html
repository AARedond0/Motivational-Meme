<h1>Metallic Starling</h1> 
<h2>Aplonis metallica</h2>


<h3>ABOUT</h3>
From a distance, the metallic starling looks just like another small black bird. However, at the right angle of sunlight, this beautiful bird shows an array of purple and green iridescence. Many starlings are native to European countries, but the aptly named metallic starling is the only starling native to Papua New Guinea, Northern Australia, and surrounding islands. This songbird is known for the spectacular swirls and shapes they create in the sky, as they travel in colonies of seemingly endless individuals. They are best known for their unique style of intricate nests that hang from the trees of their breeding ground in Northern Australia.  


<h3>Pretty bird</h3> Metallic starlings are medium-sized birds with a long, graduated tail. Males and females look alike: all-black, with red eyes and a short bill. They appear to be “metallic” because of the purple and green sheen that reflects when the sunlight hits them at just the right angle. In contrast to adults, juveniles are brown with a white patch on their chest and gray coloration on the throat. As they mature, they develop red eyes and black plumage. The final juvenile trait they lose is the white patch on their chest. 



<h3>Singing soprano</h3> These birds have a very high-pitched song when communicating to one another. Their talents have also been known to include mimicry of other neighboring birds. Gregarious in nature, these birds have a constant chatter. Nesting colonies are fairly easy to find, because of the volume of individuals vocalizing.
